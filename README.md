## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize:
- Data generation parameters (n_series, n_timesteps)
- Feature extraction settings (comprehensive features, FDR level)
- Feature selection options
- Output settings

## TSFresh Features

TSFresh automatically extracts hundreds of features:
- Statistical Features: Mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis
- Temporal Features: Autocorrelation, partial autocorrelation
- Frequency Features: FFT coefficients, spectral entropy
- Complexity Features: Approximate entropy, sample entropy

## Feature Selection

- Uses statistical tests to identify relevant features
- Controls False Discovery Rate (FDR)
- Reduces dimensionality while preserving information

## Caveats

- By default, generates synthetic time series data.
- Feature extraction can be computationally intensive for large datasets.
- Comprehensive feature set includes 700+ features by default.
- Feature selection requires target variable (y) for supervised learning.
